# CSULArTPC-Radon_Analysis
Running repository of scripts used to analyze data from the August 2024 Radon Injection tests at CSU. 

All scripts currently work, aiming to modfy each such that they rely on funcs.py - last one to do is BiPoHistogrammer - all others have been modified to a common format.
